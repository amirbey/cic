If you're just getting started with the cloud, the first thing to know is that there is no one "cloud." Moving to the cloud isn't as easy or as simple as unplugging existing servers and turning them over to a Cloud Service Provider (CSP).  You will need to evaluate your current and future needs and select the best deployment and services models that meet your current and future needs and support and meet your organizations mission.

### What is Cloud?

Different people have different definitions, but government follows guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). NIST has identified these five essential characteristics of cloud — and in order to be properly considered "cloud," any third-party system must meet them.

### Cloud Deployment Models

NIST has also defined four different types of cloud:

<p>&nbsp;</p>

* **Public clouds** allow multiple organizations — from both the public and private sectors — to access the same computing resources. This drives innovation, as well as economies of scale. It's a mistake to assume public clouds aren't secure; many public clouds are FedRAMP-authorized and supported by large security teams, and industry relies on these types of clouds to keep their information safe. Unless the information you need to store is sensitive, a public cloud could easily meet your security requirements. If you do need additional data safeguarding, some cloud providers offer special government-only clouds that are "public" while still meeting higher levels of security and compliance.

* ***Private clouds** offer the same characteristics as a public cloud, but are only available to a single agency, they rarely offer the same benefits as a public cloud. A large part of what makes clouds more efficient is that computing resources are pooled; when an agency relies on its own private cloud, it sacrifices the efficiency and scale offered from pooled resources. Additionally, private clouds are more likely to be "cloud" in name only - more accurately described as outsourcing of the data center - because they lack self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity or expansion.

* **Community clouds** are cloud resources shared by multiple (usually just a few) organizations with similar interests and requirements — for example, defense, intelligence, or medical communities. It's effectively a middle ground between a public and private cloud; some of the innovation and cost savings are still available because some or all of the resources are shared. Community clouds can be hosted on-premises by one agency or off-site via a Cloud Service Provider (CSP).

* ***Hybrid clouds** are really multiple types of clouds (i.e., public, private, community) working together by standard or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability, coordinated by a cloud broker that federates data, applications, user identity, security, and other details. Hybrid cloud providers are responsible for managing resources based on agencies requirements. As with a private cloud model, it's important to make sure your "cloud" services actually make the most of cloud's benefits; ask potential vendors about the five National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) characteristics listed above.

### Cloud Service Models

In addition to selecting the deployment model(s), the appropriate service model(s) also need to be selected. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has defined three cloud computing service models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). These different cloud service models work together, the underlying infrastructure supporting the platforms, and those platforms in turn support the application software.

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Cloud Service Models" src="https://hallways.cap.gsa.gov/system/files/Cloud%20Computing%202-1552506567.png" style="height:599px; width:662px" title="" /></p>

			<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;</p>
			<p style="text-align:left"><br />
			Outsource the physical parts of computing: power, cooling, racks, connectivity, and more. IaaS solutions give you full control over virtual machines, which can be both a positive and a negative: just like on-premises, the configuration is highly customizable, but just like on-premises, staff (or contractors) are required to manage and maintain everything but the hardware. That includes operating systems, databases, and compliance, as well as any applications installed on top of the operating systems.</p>

			<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;</p>
			<p style="text-align:left"><br />
			Outsource both infrastructure and operations. With PaaS, the provider is&nbsp; responsible for&nbsp; system administration, operating systems, or networking.&nbsp; &nbsp;User applications are deployed on top of a set of predetermined configurations. PaaS solutions are less customizable than IaaS solutions, but also require less staff time to maintain and support &mdash; especially in terms of security and compliance.</p>

			<p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Software as a Service </strong></span></p>
			<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;</p>
			<p style="text-align:left"><br />
			Outsource everything, including the code of the applications used. Users have very little responsibility for the application software &mdash; the provider is responsible for keeping it up to date, easy to use, or compliant.&nbsp; In exchange, the user has minimal control over what the application software does, how it works or when it changes/updates. SaaS solutions, unlike other cloud models, tend to be direct end-user-facing.</p>

No one cloud deployment or service model is fundamentally better than another — each offers unique functionality.  Some deployment models may be better suited, depending on the agency's requirements.  Indeed the lines between the service models continues to blur with hybrid clouds deployed with combinations of service models becoming commonplace.
