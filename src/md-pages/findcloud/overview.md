|The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).|The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications developed using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.|The capability provided to the consumer is to use the providers applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.|

|<a href="http://hallways.cap.gsa.gov/app/#/gateway/cloud-information-center/30563/cloud-professional-services">Cloud requires a variety of Cloud&nbsp;Professional Services (CPS) including advisory, implementation, integration, and maintenance. These services can either be bundled with products/solutions or separated into other contracts</a>. Many example projects, templates, and FedRAMP-approved vendors can be found&nbsp;under the <u><a href="https://hallways.cap.gsa.gov/app/#/gateway/cloud-information-center/tab/29896">Acquisition Guidance Tab</a>|FedRAMP was designed so that once a cloud service offering has been authorized it can be reused many times. FedRAMP authorized vendors accessed via the GSA Schedule provide a simplified path for agencies to acquire products and solutions.|
