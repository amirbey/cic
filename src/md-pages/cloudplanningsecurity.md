# Why Cloud - Security Compliance

When it comes to cloud adoption, security is sometimes listed as a barrier to access. The belief that the "cloud" is less secure than the physical data centers agencies keep on premises is often unfounded.  Indeed, Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) routinely exceed the minimum security controls (e.g., physical security, information assurance) that agencies require or themselves could effectively and efficiently support.

 

##FedRAMP
 

To ensure secure commercial services for the government are provided, FedRAMP authorized Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) are pre-checked and routinely re-authorized to ensure the authorized cloud commercial services and offerings continue meet the minimum security requirements as required by the _Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA)_ and as outlined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-53 (NIST SP 800-53) _Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations_.  If your agency's cloud migration is still in its early stages, or if you don't have the capacity to manage an in-depth security and compliance process (e.g., Authorization to Operate), consider limiting your search to solutions that are FedRAMP authorized. The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring of FedRAMP Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). Under FedRAMP, a Joint Authorization Board (JAB) or an Agency may issue a Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATP) for a cloud solution that can be leveraged by your agency.

 

FedRAMP has an established list of FedRAMP Authorized cloud solutions and offers assistance and guidance to agencies as they transition to modern and secure cloud technologies. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memo _Security Authorization of Information Systems in Cloud Computing Environments_ states that agencies shall "use FedRAMP when conducting risk assessments, security authorizations, and granting Authorities to Operate (ATO) for all executive department or agency use of cloud [commercial] services."  For more detail on FedRAMP as well as Agency responsibilities with cloud, visit the Policy Directives section.

 

##Responsibilities 

Even with FedRAMP authorized Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), FISMA requires agencies to be accountable and maintain oversight of all security and compliance protocols for IT systems security, even solutions predominantly based on cloud technology.  The responsibility for the execution of controls will depend on the solution; the CSP and agency will be responsible for some specific controls, and both parties will share responsibility for other controls. The following graphic illustrates primary responsibility for areas of security controls for each cloud commercial service model.  This graphic not only helps to illustrate the value of each cloud commercial service model, but can be used as a road map to prevent security surprises concerning misunderstood or unknown requirements.

 

As indicated in the graphic, responsibility for specific security or compliance controls depends on the type of cloud solution that is procured. Software as a service (SaaS) users are typically responsible for very little; Platform as a service (PaaS) users only have to secure their applications; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) users will have to secure the platforms and software. A good rule of thumb is that one is usually responsible for what can be customized; if it's automatically set up, the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is likely responsible for its security and compliance. (However, there are exceptions to this: for example, sometimes a CSP will provide the tools needed to maintain security and compliance, but it'll be the agency's responsibility to make sure that tool is used correctly.) 

Understanding this shared responsibility model is fundamental to procuring and securely living in the cloud.
