# Technical Implementation

Before one can transition to the cloud, it's important to know what systems are currently in place. An accurate and complete inventory/assessment of your assets is critical for IT management and successful migration of those assets to the cloud.

Ideally, everyone would have information for every single IT asset their currently responsible for. However, the complex reality of IT makes doing this difficult at best and impossible at worst. Instead of trying to do everything at once, start with a pilot — if moving a single system to the cloud, focus solely on the assets that touch that system.

Inventory and assessment can be split into three discrete stages.

1. **Inventory** - document and organize all existing IT assets. Where, physically, is your technology? How does it interact with other systems? Who's responsible for it? This information can be gathered both from stakeholders and from automated scans. 

Once all assets are documented, the second stage is...

2. [**Application Rationalization**](https://community.max.gov/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=Egov&title=Application+Rationalization+Materials) (OMB MAX Login Required) - What's the business case for your systems? (In other words, are they still serving their original purpose?) Do they need to be moved to cloud, kept on-premises, merged, or shut down? Do they need re-engineering, are they optimal as-is, or is a cloud ready solution available (e.g., commercial product)? Here is a direct link to the Federal CIO Council's [Application Rationalization Handbook](https://www.cio.gov/assets/files/Application-Rationalization-Playbook.pdf).

After this is known, the third and final stage is...

3. **Planning for Migration** - This includes risk assessments and financial considerations. What can be afforded now, and what should be budgeted for the new fiscal year? What's a good system to use as a pilot — accommodate your learning curve!


If you are unable to perform all of this on your own, there are vendors who can help. At the request of OMB, GSA has developed [Statement of Objectives (SOO) templates](https://hallways.cap.gsa.gov/app/#/gateway/cloud-information-center/30605/templates) that can used to acquire cloud support services for things like assessment, planning, execution, and decommissioning.

Whether taking this task on yourself or bringing in outside help, all agencies — regardless of their existing network documentation — should map out their enterprise networks when they decide to move to the cloud. Many agencies who thought they knew their networks are surprised when they enter the discovery phase and find unknown endpoints or unexpected traffic patterns.
